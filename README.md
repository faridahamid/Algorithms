# Algorithms in C++

This repository contains a collection of algorithm implementations in C++.  
It includes a variety of classic problems covering topics such as graph algorithms, dynamic programming, greedy methods, divide and conquer strategies, and basic data structures.  

##  Overview

Algorithms are the backbone of computer science, powering everything from basic search engines to complex artificial intelligence systems.  

The algorithms are grouped across several paradigms, including:

- **Greedy Algorithms**
- **Graph Algorithms**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Divide and Conquer**
- **Data Structures**
